## Reflections

- **Getting Started with TypeScript**
  In this module I learned what TS is, how it differs from JS and how it improves it.
  I learned where I can write code in TS (any text editor or IDE), how to install TS (necessary packages and config file), how create projects in this language in VSC and how to compile it into JS.
  After passing this module I got basic knowledge to start working with TS and now I can use it to write code for my projects.
- **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**
  By completing this module I gained a deeper understanding of the key difference and advantage of TS, namely that as a strictly typed language it allows you to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allows for code validation.
  I learned what data types are available in TS , as well as how you can associate types with variables through explicit type annotations or through implicit type inference.
  Applying the acquired knowledge I learned to declare variables using primitive types, object types, union and intersection types.
  These skills in practice will allow me to avoid many errors and to handle values of unknown types more correctly.
