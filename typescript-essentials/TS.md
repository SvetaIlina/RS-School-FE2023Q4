## Reflections

- **Getting Started with TypeScript**
  In this module I learned what TS is, how it differs from JS and how it improves it.
  I learned where I can write code in TS (any text editor or IDE), how to install TS (necessary packages and config file), how create projects in this language in VSC and how to compile it into JS.
  After passing this module I got basic knowledge to start working with TS and now I can use it to write code for my projects.
