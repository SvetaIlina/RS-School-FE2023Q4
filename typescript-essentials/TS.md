## Reflections

- **Getting Started with TypeScript**  
  In this module I learned what TS is, how it differs from JS and how it improves it.
  I learned where I can write code in TS (any text editor or IDE), how to install TS (necessary packages and config file), how create projects in this language in VSC and how to compile it into JS.
  After passing this module I got basic knowledge to start working with TS and now I can use it to write code for my projects.
- **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**  
  By completing this module I gained a deeper understanding of the key difference and advantage of TS, namely that as a strictly typed language it allows you to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allows for code validation.
  I learned what data types are available in TS , as well as how you can associate types with variables through explicit type annotations or through implicit type inference.
  Applying the acquired knowledge I learned to declare variables using primitive types, object types, union and intersection types.
  These skills in practice will allow me to avoid many errors and to handle values of unknown types more correctly.
- **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**  
  In this module, I gained an understanding of what an interface is, its main tasks, and its practical applications.
  I learned that interfaces are often the key point of contact between any two pieces of TypeScript code, especially when working with existing JavaScript code or embedded JavaScript objects.
  They are particularly useful for documenting and verifying the required form of properties, objects passed as parameters, and objects returned from functions. This allows you to catch errors and make sure you pass the correct parameters at compile time, rather than waiting for them to be learned about at runtime.
  I also realized the difference between interfaces and type aliases, namely that a type alias cannot be reopened to add new properties, whereas an interface can always be extended.
  Knowing what properties an interface can have (mandatory, optional, or read-only) and that interfaces can extend each other will allow us to create more flexible and reusable Also, an interface can be used to describe array types and create custom array types, as well as to describe and JavaScript API, which gives us the ability to work with external JavaScript libraries
