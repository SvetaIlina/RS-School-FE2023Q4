Hi, my name is Sveta and I'm an aspiring front-end developer.
And now I'm going to tell you how I came to this.

One day I had a question: is what I am doing now really my vocation and I am ready to do it all my life?
Do I like my job? Am I happy with my salary? Do I feel satisfied with my work? Do I have opportunities for career growth?
And when the answer to most of those questions was no, I realized that i should to change something.

I wanted something creative, so I thought why not try design?
As I took the UI/UX design course, I became more interested not in how it should look like,but how to make it work.

So, having a good math background and technical mindset, I decided to take up frontend development.
I took a few popular free courses to make sure that it's definitely mine, and yes, I definitely realized - I like it! And most importantly, I'm getting somewhere. So I have to keep going.

Lern JS has become my desk book, my browser bookmarks have changed from TV series and entertainment portals to resources for learning, youtube recommendations started to include more and more web development channels. I took a couple of courses with udemy, my googling skills increased thousands of times.....But something was missing. Yes, knowledge definitely appeared and even multiplied,but everything was like in isolation from reality.

It was then that I came across a mention of rs-scholl. Hmmm, that's what I need, I thought, and I was not mistaken.
A huge database of useful material, a powerful community of like-minded people, practical tasks with deadlines, crosschecks - all this gave me a powerful boost both skills - in layout and coding, and soft skills (try to change the reviewer's mind).
But at the same time I realized that there are thousands of people like me, and to be noticed you need to be one of the best.
My goal was to do my tasks to the maximum, while getting the maximum knowledge and skills.

At first, reading of the tasks requirements, I had only one thought: it's impossible! But step by step I brought the case to the end, and what at the beginning was frightening, at the end seemed simple and understandable.

The main thing is to overcome yourself and start to act! Even if the process will not be easy, even if there will be mistakes, but after overcoming all difficulties, you will become really better.

With this thought I came to the end of Stage 1. I plan to pass Stage2 with the same fighting spirit and continue on React course.

I am sure that the knowledge and experience gained from these courses will help me find a job where I can grow professionally, and in a few years I will be able to say: Hi, my name is Sveta and I am a senior Front-end developer!
